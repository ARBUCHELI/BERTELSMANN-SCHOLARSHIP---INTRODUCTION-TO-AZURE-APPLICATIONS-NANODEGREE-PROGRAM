# BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM

## This repository contains exercises from Bertelsmann Scholarship. Introduction to Azure Applications Nanodegree Program.

## LESSON 1 INTRODUCTION TO MICROSOFT AZURE DEVELOPMENT:

## Prerequisites:

To succeed in this course, students should have experience in the following areas:

* Python (1-3 years of programming experience preferred), with experience building Flask apps
* SQL Server or MySQL to store and query data (you can get by with other SQL flavors as well)
* Using Git to pull and push code

## Lesson Outline:

This lesson will focus on the following topics under Microsoft Azure Cloud Development:

* Why cloud computing is important, when to use it, and who are the key stakeholders
* History of the cloud
* Microsoft Azure and Azure Portal
* Comparing cloud service types (such as Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service)
* Tools and environment set up for the course
* The final course project

## Course Outline:

The course is divided into 3 major sections - Azure Compute Services, Storage Options in Azure, and Security, Monitoring and Logging.

## Introduction to Cloud Development:

The cloud is a collection of servers on the internet that store and manage data, run apps, and deliver content such as email or videos. Cloud computing is the delivery of software and storage over the Internet (i.e. the cloud).

Some of the benefits of using cloud computing are:

* Cost
* Scale
* Reliability
* Security

The three major types of cloud services are Public, Private, and Hybrid cloud. The major differences between these are in where they are deployed, and who manages them. Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Office365 are examples of public cloud options.

Cloud Developers perform some of the following:

* Plan and design cloud based apps
* Monitor, maintain and support cloud applications
* Develop work flows and processes

## Why Cloud Development Is Important

You've probably worked with various cloud services before, such as Microsoft OneDrive and Google Docs, and of course, you'll be working with Microsoft Azure in this course.

Some of the advantages of cloud computing are:

* Cost: The cloud provider handles all the upfront costs associated with buying hardware, along with on-going maintenance costs
* Scale: Most are pay-as-you-go depending on demand (elasticity), and can be expanded as needed
* Reliability: Management of backups, disaster recovery, etc. is made easier
* Security: Policies and controls are already in place to protect your data

Some of the disadvantages of cloud computing are:

* It is internet-based, so it can be prone to outages and fluctuations in speed
* Sensitive, private and core data is physically located on someone else's server
* Cloud services will be tailored and customized for your specific cloud instance, potentially making it hard to quickly change providers
