## Prerequisites:

To succeed in this course, students should have experience in the following areas:

* Python (1-3 years of programming experience preferred), with experience building Flask apps
* SQL Server or MySQL to store and query data (you can get by with other SQL flavors as well)
* Using Git to pull and push code

## Lesson Outline:

This lesson will focus on the following topics under Microsoft Azure Cloud Development:

* Why cloud computing is important, when to use it, and who are the key stakeholders
* History of the cloud
* Microsoft Azure and Azure Portal
* Comparing cloud service types (such as Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service)
* Tools and environment set up for the course

## Introduction to Cloud Development:

The cloud is a collection of servers on the internet that store and manage data, run apps, and deliver content such as email or videos. Cloud computing is the delivery of software and storage over the Internet (i.e. the cloud).

Some of the benefits of using cloud computing are:

* Cost
* Scale
* Reliability
* Security

The three major types of cloud services are Public, Private, and Hybrid cloud. The major differences between these are in where they are deployed, and who manages them. Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Office365 are examples of public cloud options.

Cloud Developers perform some of the following:

* Plan and design cloud based apps
* Monitor, maintain and support cloud applications
* Develop work flows and processes

## Why Cloud Development Is Important

You've probably worked with various cloud services before, such as Microsoft OneDrive and Google Docs, and of course, you'll be working with Microsoft Azure in this course.

Some of the advantages of cloud computing are:

* Cost: The cloud provider handles all the upfront costs associated with buying hardware, along with on-going maintenance costs
* Scale: Most are pay-as-you-go depending on demand (elasticity), and can be expanded as needed
* Reliability: Management of backups, disaster recovery, etc. is made easier
* Security: Policies and controls are already in place to protect your data

Some of the disadvantages of cloud computing are:

* It is internet-based, so it can be prone to outages and fluctuations in speed
* Sensitive, private and core data is physically located on someone else's server
* Cloud services will be tailored and customized for your specific cloud instance, potentially making it hard to quickly change providers

## Business Stakeholders

As a cloud developer, you will interact and engage with numerous stakeholders, each of whom has different priorities. Some of these are:

* Your users
* Company executives
* I.T. Department
* Cloud Service provider
* Finance Department

## History of Cloud Development

The roots of cloud computing go as far back as the 1960s.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/8.jpg)

1969 - JCR Licklider aimed to create a system where information could be accessed anywhere in the world called the “Intergalactic Computer Network”.

1980s - Supercomputing Centers start to form and Commercial Internet Service Providers start to emerge in the late 1980s.

1990 - The internet becomes visible to all when Tim Berners-Lee invents the World Wide Web.

1999 - Salesforce.com launches and becomes a pioneer in delivering enterprise applications over the internet, which is known as Software-as-a-Service(SaaS). This paves the way for other SaaS applications such as Microsoft 365 and Gmail.

2002 - Amazon launches its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. AWS is formally launched as a business unit in 2006.

2006 - Amazon launches its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a commercial web service that allowed users to rent computers to run their applications. EC2 paved the way for application delivery over the internet, which allowed web-scaled businesses like Netflix and Spotify to exist.

2007 - Dropbox introduces its file hosting service, and with that cloud storage becomes a commodity.

2008 - Google launches its Google App Engine (GAE) Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). This service allowed developers to host their web applications on Google’s managed data centers.

2010 - Microsoft launches its cloud computing platform, Azure, after announcing it back in 2008. Azure now covers Software-as-a-Service(SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS).

2011 - IBM launches SmartCloud, a suite of enterprise-class cloud computing technologies for building private, public, and hybrid clouds.

2013 - Google launches Google Compute Engine (GCE) as an addition to its Google Compute Platform. This is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) component of the platform that allows a user to spin up Virtual Machines (VMs) on demand.

So what’s next? Cloud computing is on the rise in this day and age. As cloud computing continues to become more mainstream, more and more companies are looking to adopt it. Industries such as marketing, education, and healthcare are beginning to increase their use of cloud-based services and platforms.

## Microsoft Azure

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/9.jpg)

Azure is a public computing platform with tremendous value and benefits:

* Scalability: can dynamically handle changes in volume, bandwidth, storage size
* Availability: redundant on a global scale with 99.9%+ uptime (see SLA by service here)
* Security: replicated data helps protect against natural disaster, while authentication strategies help secure access to the data
* Standard delivery pipeline development services, such as:
  * Source control
  * Unit testing
  * Integration testing
  * Delivery
* Live development tools

Azure products span multiple categories, such as Compute, Analytics, Databases, A.I. and Machine Learning.

The Azure products this course will focus on are:

* App Services
* Virtual Machines
* Azure SQL Databases
* Blob Storage
* Azure Active Directory
* Aspects of Azure Monitor, such as logs and alerts

## The Azure Portal

## IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS

In contrast to on-premises solutions, there are three types of services that Azure offers us:

* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - removes the expense of up-front costs of hardware, software and test environments
* Platform as a Service (PaaS) - handles networking, provides middleware and development & database tools
* Software as a Service (SaaS) - provides end-users access to online cloud solutions

## Tools & Environment

## Project: Deploy an Article CMS to Azure

It is exciting to take a look at what we will be creating in our <strong>final course project</strong>. Similar to many such systems that exist in the real world, we will be designing, building, and deploying an Article Content Management System (CMS), which will include the ability to :

* Login and authenticate
* Read posts
* Create and save a post
* Edit and save an existing post

The project looks straightforward from the user interface, but there is a lot going on under the hood of this Flask app. The Sign In page makes use of the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and Azure Active Directory to log in with a Microsoft account, while data related to article titles, authors and text bodies is stored in an Azure SQL Server. An Azure Storage Account with Blob Storage is used to store the images, and the web app itself can be deployed using either an Azure Virtual Machine or an Azure App Service. All of these resources are likely tied to a single resource group.

All these terms may not make much sense to you yet, but by the end of the course, you'll know each resource involved quite well, and be able to deploy your own Article CMS with Azure!
