## Introduction to Cloud Development:

The cloud is a collection of servers on the internet that store and manage data, run apps, and deliver content such as email or videos. Cloud computing is the delivery of software and storage over the Internet (i.e. the cloud).

Some of the benefits of using cloud computing are:

Cost
Scale
Reliability
Security
The three major types of cloud services are Public, Private, and Hybrid cloud. The major differences between these are in where they are deployed, and who manages them. Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Office365 are examples of public cloud options.

Cloud Developers perform some of the following:

Plan and design cloud based apps
Monitor, maintain and support cloud applications
Develop work flows and processes
