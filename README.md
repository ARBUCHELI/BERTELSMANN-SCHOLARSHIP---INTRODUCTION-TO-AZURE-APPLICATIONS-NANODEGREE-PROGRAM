## Introduction to Cloud Development:

The cloud is a collection of servers on the internet that store and manage data, run apps, and deliver content such as email or videos. Cloud computing is the delivery of software and storage over the Internet (i.e. the cloud).

Some of the benefits of using cloud computing are:

* Cost
* Scale
* Reliability
* Security

The three major types of cloud services are Public, Private, and Hybrid cloud. The major differences between these are in where they are deployed, and who manages them. Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Office365 are examples of public cloud options.

Cloud Developers perform some of the following:

* Plan and design cloud based apps
* Monitor, maintain and support cloud applications
* Develop work flows and processes

## Why Cloud Development Is Important

You've probably worked with various cloud services before, such as Microsoft OneDrive and Google Docs, and of course, you'll be working with Microsoft Azure in this course.

Some of the advantages of cloud computing are:

* Cost: The cloud provider handles all the upfront costs associated with buying hardware, along with on-going maintenance costs
* Scale: Most are pay-as-you-go depending on demand (elasticity), and can be expanded as needed
* Reliability: Management of backups, disaster recovery, etc. is made easier
* Security: Policies and controls are already in place to protect your data

Some of the disadvantages of cloud computing are:

* It is internet-based, so it can be prone to outages and fluctuations in speed
* Sensitive, private and core data is physically located on someone else's server
* Cloud services will be tailored and customized for your specific cloud instance, potentially making it hard to quickly change providers

## Business Stakeholders

As a cloud developer, you will interact and engage with numerous stakeholders, each of whom has different priorities. Some of these are:

* Your users
* Company executives
* I.T. Department
* Cloud Service provider
* Finance Department

## History of Cloud Development

The roots of cloud computing go as far back as the 1960s.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/8.jpg)

1969 - JCR Licklider aimed to create a system where information could be accessed anywhere in the world called the “Intergalactic Computer Network”.

1980s - Supercomputing Centers start to form and Commercial Internet Service Providers start to emerge in the late 1980s.

1990 - The internet becomes visible to all when Tim Berners-Lee invents the World Wide Web.

1999 - Salesforce.com launches and becomes a pioneer in delivering enterprise applications over the internet, which is known as Software-as-a-Service(SaaS). This paves the way for other SaaS applications such as Microsoft 365 and Gmail.

2002 - Amazon launches its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. AWS is formally launched as a business unit in 2006.

2006 - Amazon launches its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a commercial web service that allowed users to rent computers to run their applications. EC2 paved the way for application delivery over the internet, which allowed web-scaled businesses like Netflix and Spotify to exist.

2007 - Dropbox introduces its file hosting service, and with that cloud storage becomes a commodity.

2008 - Google launches its Google App Engine (GAE) Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). This service allowed developers to host their web applications on Google’s managed data centers.

2010 - Microsoft launches its cloud computing platform, Azure, after announcing it back in 2008. Azure now covers Software-as-a-Service(SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS).

2011 - IBM launches SmartCloud, a suite of enterprise-class cloud computing technologies for building private, public, and hybrid clouds.

2013 - Google launches Google Compute Engine (GCE) as an addition to its Google Compute Platform. This is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) component of the platform that allows a user to spin up Virtual Machines (VMs) on demand.

So what’s next? Cloud computing is on the rise in this day and age. As cloud computing continues to become more mainstream, more and more companies are looking to adopt it. Industries such as marketing, education, and healthcare are beginning to increase their use of cloud-based services and platforms.

## Microsoft Azure

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/9.jpg)

Azure is a public computing platform with tremendous value and benefits:

* Scalability: can dynamically handle changes in volume, bandwidth, storage size
* Availability: redundant on a global scale with 99.9%+ uptime (see SLA by service here)
* Security: replicated data helps protect against natural disaster, while authentication strategies help secure access to the data
* Standard delivery pipeline development services, such as:
  * Source control
  * Unit testing
  * Integration testing
  * Delivery
* Live development tools

Azure products span multiple categories, such as Compute, Analytics, Databases, A.I. and Machine Learning.

The Azure products this course will focus on are:

* App Services
* Virtual Machines
* Azure SQL Databases
* Blob Storage
* Azure Active Directory
* Aspects of Azure Monitor, such as logs and alerts

## The Azure Portal

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/11.jpg)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/12.jpg)

## IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS

In contrast to on-premises solutions, there are three types of services that Azure offers us:

* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - removes the expense of up-front costs of hardware, software and test environments
* Platform as a Service (PaaS) - handles networking, provides middleware and development & database tools
* Software as a Service (SaaS) - provides end-users access to online cloud solutions

## Project: Deploy an Article CMS to Azure

It is exciting to take a look at what we will be creating in our <strong>final course project</strong>. Similar to many such systems that exist in the real world, we will be designing, building, and deploying an Article Content Management System (CMS), which will include the ability to :

* Login and authenticate
* Read posts
* Create and save a post
* Edit and save an existing post

The project looks straightforward from the user interface, but there is a lot going on under the hood of this Flask app. The Sign In page makes use of the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and Azure Active Directory to log in with a Microsoft account, while data related to article titles, authors and text bodies is stored in an Azure SQL Server. An Azure Storage Account with Blob Storage is used to store the images, and the web app itself can be deployed using either an Azure Virtual Machine or an Azure App Service. All of these resources are likely tied to a single resource group.

All these terms may not make much sense to you yet, but by the end of the course, you'll know each resource involved quite well, and be able to deploy your own Article CMS with Azure!

# LESSON 2 AZURE COMPUTE DEVICES

## Introduction

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/17.jpg)

In this lesson, we'll focus on Azure Compute Services:

* First, we'll take a look at some of the various compute options available
* Then, we'll get you set up for success by discussing subscriptions and resource groups
* From there, we'll take a deeper dive into two compute services in Azure: Virtual Machines and App Services
* After comparing and contrasting these two, you'll create both resources and deploy an app to them

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f10a6cb_course-outline-compute/course-outline-compute.png)

## Big Picture: Compute Services

There are a lot of compute services available through Azure, each with their own use cases. You can check out a good chart for deciding when to use each (which you'll see more of in later lessons and courses) in the Microsoft documentation. Some of the available options are:

* Virtual Machines
* App Services
* Azure Batch
* Azure Functions
* Container Instances
* Service Fabric
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

We'll focus on Virtual Machines and App Services in this lesson, although you'll see some of the others in a later course.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/18.jpg)

## Subscriptions and Resource Groups

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/19.jpg)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/20.jpg)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/21.jpg)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/BERTELSMANN-SCHOLARSHIP---INTRODUCTION-TO-AZURE-APPLICATIONS-NANODEGREE-PROGRAM/main/Images/22.jpg)

This starts at the top with your <strong>Azure Account</strong>. The next level down is the <strong>Subscription</strong> level; in this course you will likely only work with one subscription, but it's likely in your day-to-day Azure work that you may be working with more than one. For instance, there may be one subscription for development and testing, and another for production systems.

Below the subscription level is where you'll find <strong>Resource Groups</strong>. These help to organize resources you use, such as Virtual Machines and App Services (as well as storage options and other resources we'll discuss in later lessons), in order to make resource management easier. You may have a resource group for a specific project, or because resource groups are tied to a <strong>Region</strong>, you may have resource groups containing similar resources in multiple locations across the world. A region contains at least one data center, but could have multiple data centers that are close by and networked together through a low-latency network. There are over 60 regions available worldwide and available in 140 countries, such as East US and Japan West.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f108911_subscription-resource-group-hierarchy/subscription-resource-group-hierarchy.png)

When choosing a region, it's important to consider what you are trying to achieve. For development and testing purposes, you likely want a region close to yourself; for production purposes, you often want resources to be close to your user. Keep the following in mind:

* Service availability - Some services may not be available in a particular region.
* Performance - Latency determines network service performance; are you creating resources for yourself or your end user?
* Cost - Costs of services vary by region. If latency isn’t an issue, you might want to deploy your services in the cheapest region.

### Creating a Resource Group in the Azure Portal

To set up a resource group in the Azure Portal:

* Go to the [Azure Portal homepage](http://portal.azure.com/)
* Click "Create a Resource Group"
* Search for "Resource group" and click "Create"
* You'll need to select the subscription for the resource group, name it, and select a region
* Make sure once you select "Review and create" to actually review the information! While it doesn't take too much time to go back and create a new resource group, you'll want to check for any typos in the name or if the wrong region was selected. When we work out of Azure CLI later, this becomes even more important, as you could cause other scripts to fail if things are named incorrectly or are in an inappropriate region.
* Click "Create" once you are done reviewing.

You'll practice this yourself in the upcoming exercise.

## Exercise: Create A Resource Group

In this exercise, you'll create a resource group in Azure. This is a quick exercise, but will set you up for success through the rest of the course!

* Create a Resource Group named <strong>resource-group-west</strong> in Azure in the <strong>West US</strong> region.

<strong>Note:</strong> We will use this resource group throughout the course, so do not delete it after creation. Resource Groups are fully covered in the Azure free account.

## Solution (Alternative Solution using the CLI)

### Steps to Create a Resource Group using the Azure CLI:

* 1. Log in using az login.
* 2. We'll use the Azure CLI command az group create and pass in two flags:
   * resource group --name
   * --location which is the same as the "region" field on the Azure portal.
* 3. If you want to see a list of all locations, you can run az account list-locations -o table to output the list in table format.
* 4. I want to create my resource group in the West US 2 region:

az group create --name resource-group-west --location westus2

The resource group will be created and a JSON response will be returned with the status.

Alternatively, you can check out the screenshot below for how you might do the same from the Portal (note that the below uses the West US region and not West US 2).
